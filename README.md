# Scan_and_Grab
Student-made port scanner for CYB333! 

# Project Goals & Problem Solving
Automation: Create a tool that can provide cybersecurity professionals with the ability to automate  & improve efficiency.

Security: Create a tool that can assist with providing confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility on a node or network.

Identification: Create a tool that can help identify potential vulnerabilities and actions on a node or network.

# Why Automation?
There are many vulnerabilities that can threaten a network, therefore it is important that administrators and cybersecurity professionals alike are able to intervene and remediate issues in real time. This is where automated tools like Scan_and_Grab come into play to improve the time it takes to perform audits by performing automated port scans on targeted machines

# Why Security?
While port scanning is not a great form of security on its own, it is important to run one like Scan_and_Grab that can identify what ports are open on a node. This collection of data plays a part in making sure that only the appropriate ports are open so as not to risk the unauthorized release of confidential information which could risk the integrity of data as well as how available that data is to authorized users.

# Why Identification?
Identifying where vulnerabilities stem from is the first step to managing security on a node, and when it comes to ports they can open unexpected doors for attackers and hackers alike. But utilizing a port scanner like Scan_and_Grab administrators are able to identify ports that invite unauthorized users and close them if need be.
